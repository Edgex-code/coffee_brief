    "content": "Stock markets in Asia remained flat as investors continued to worry about trade wars, especially between the U.S. and China. At the same time, the U.S. dollar weakened compared to other major currencies, often a sign that investors expect lower interest rates. Supporting that view, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond dropped again, following a 0.10 percentage point fall the day before. This reflects growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates twice this year to help the slowing economy."
