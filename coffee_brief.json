    "content": "Global stock markets ended late December and opened 2026 with strong gains, with major U.S. indices like the Dow Jones and S&P 500 setting new record highs. Investors were active despite the holiday-shortened week, and both energy and defence sectors helped lift equities as optimism carried over into the first week of the year. The FTSE-100 in London also climbed to record levels near and above 10,000 points, reflecting broader risk appetite. Overall, markets navigated thin liquidity, year-end position adjustments, and early signals for 2026 with a rally-biased tone. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}"

    "title": "Geopolitical Shock in Venezuela Drives Energy, Bonds, Metals and Safe-Haven Trades",
    "content": "A dominant theme was the U.S. military’s capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, which rippled through global markets. Energy shares — particularly U.S. oil and oil-services stocks — surged on expectations of future Venezuelan oil sector participation, even though production remains limited. Venezuelan government bonds jumped sharply as investors repositioned around possible debt restructuring. Precious metals like gold and silver also climbed as geopolitical risk prompted safe-haven flows, while commodity and defence sectors saw strong performance. However, analysts noted that any meaningful increase in Venezuelan oil output will likely take years of investment and faces significant economic and political uncertainty. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}"

    "content": "Alongside the headline equity rallies and geopolitical moves, broader markets showed mixed signals. Oil prices experienced modest moves despite the Venezuela situation, reflecting substantial global supply and OPEC+ dynamics. The U.S. dollar remained firm as a dominant global currency amid ongoing risk and policy uncertainty. Technology and AI-related stocks continued to underpin market gains in the U.S., especially as investors looked ahead to key industry events and earnings. Other asset classes like bonds and currencies responded to shifting expectations around inflation, jobs data, and central bank policy in the new year. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}"
