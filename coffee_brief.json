    "content": "Stock markets in Asia remained flat as investors continued to worry about trade wars, especially between the U.S. and China. At the same time, the U.S. dollar weakened compared to other major currencies, often a sign that investors expect lower interest rates. Supporting that view, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond dropped again, following a 0.10 percentage point fall the day before. This reflects growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates twice this year to help the slowing economy."

    "content": "European markets are under watch as China's trade surplus with the EU grows. This means China is selling more to Europe than it's buying, raising concerns that European industries may suffer from a flood of cheap imports. Meanwhile, hopes for a peace deal in Ukraine were dampened when Russian President Putin sent only a junior delegation to new talks in Turkey, signaling low commitment to ending the conflict."

    "content": "Chinese and Hong Kong stock markets performed worse than their Asian neighbors. Alibaba’s stock fell after its financial results didn't meet investor expectations. A Bloomberg survey suggests that the current 30% U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods are expected to remain in place through late 2025, adding long-term pressure on Chinese exporters. Additionally, former President Trump’s new deals involving artificial intelligence with Middle Eastern countries are causing friction within his team, especially among those wary of China's influence in tech."
